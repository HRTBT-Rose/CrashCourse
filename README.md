Use your jetpack to fly around an abandoned power plantÂ in this retro puzzle-platformer.  
Crash Course features grid-based movement and limited fuel to get to the end of each level, the challenge is to be smart with how you use your jetpack to ensure that you have enough fuel to collect the uranium at the end of the stage.

This was my first game project in Unreal, I made it as a loveletter to the original DMG Gameboy, but it's only a small proof-of-concept.
